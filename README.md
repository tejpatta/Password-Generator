# Password-Generator

## Description

This webpage was created in response to a  boot camp assignment to apply skills learnt in JavaScript, particularly array methods. 

This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML powered by JavaScript.

The webpage asks for user input through 'confirms' and generates a random password based on their choices. The user can elect to have lower case characters, upper case characters, special characters, and numerals in their password. They must choose at least one. They will then receive their password.

## Installation

Accessible on Git Hub Pages at the link below in 'usage'.

## Usage
The site can be accessed here: 

Click the 'Generate Password' to begin. Input a number when asked for the length of password you'd like, and then click 'OK' for the following options if you want to include them, and 'Cancel' if you do not wish to include a particular character type. You must choose at least one character type to include. You will then see your randomly generated password in the text box! Copy it and use it wherever you'd like.
